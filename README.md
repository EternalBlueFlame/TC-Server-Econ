# TC-Server-Econ
building schematics and economy files for the official traincraft server


#Millenaire stuff
All econ values should go into the universal file.
schematics should follow the same setup as vanilla millenaire (documentation below).

New building schematics must maintain the same size as previous ones.

various documentation for new content and setting up econd ata can be found here:

other notes:
Millenaire Developer mode can be enabled by adding the following to millenaire-custom/config.txt

devmode=true

Used to rapidly test of the game and add-ons, it allows you to read debug variables from villagers, complete construction projects instantly, access town inventories, and add new villagers. Additional functionality is added to the Summoning Wand.

Using the village wand in devmode on the main chest in the town centre building will automatically finish whatever building that is in construction. 
Using the wand on female villagers will make them spawn children. 
Devmode will also allow you to directly place materials into locked chests. 
Using the wand on children will grow them to teens instantly. 
Right clicking the main chest, holding smooth stone block will show build-able space in colored wool.


#Non-Millenaire stuff
we need to find a place and organization for this.
